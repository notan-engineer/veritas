# 6. Optional - Advanced Anti-Blocking - New

## User Story
As a System Administrator, if the scraper fails due to IP blocking, I want to integrate residential proxies and stateful session management, so that the scraper can avoid detection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given a source that was blocking requests, when the scraper is re-run with `ProxyConfiguration` and `useSessionPool`, then the requests succeed.
