# 3. Mandatory - Configuration Generation Script - New

## User Story
As a Developer, I want a script that can automatically generate a configuration file for a new source, so that I can provide an LLM with all the necessary context to write a high-quality, specific handler, dramatically speeding up the onboarding process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A new standalone script is created (e.g., in `services/scraper/scripts/`).
- [ ] The script accepts a source name (that exists in the `sources` table) as an argument.
- [ ] The script fetches and scrapes the full HTML of 2 sample articles from the source's RSS feed.
- [ ] The script outputs a single markdown file named `[SourceName]-handler-config.md`.
- [ ] The output file's content is well-structured and includes: the full HTML of the sample articles (within code blocks), and a set of clear, templated instructions for an LLM on how to create the source-specific handler code.
- [ ] A `prompt-template.md` file is created within the project, defining the precise structure and instructions that the generation script will use to wrap the sample HTML
- [ ] The prompt template includes:
  - [ ] Reference to the `ScrapedArticle` interface from the Handler Quality Standards
  - [ ] Instructions on using the shared utilities from `utils/`
  - [ ] Examples of proper error handling with `HandlerError`
  - [ ] Reminders about content cleaning requirements
  - [ ] A clear request for accompanying unit tests
