# 5. Optional - Headless Upgrade - New

## User Story
As a System Administrator, if the scraper fails due to JavaScript challenges, I want to upgrade the engine to `PlaywrightCrawler`, so that I can extract data from dynamic websites.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given a source that failed with Cheerio, when the scraper is re-run with the Playwright engine, then the articles are successfully extracted.
- [ ] The router architecture works with the new `PlaywrightCrawler`.
