# 1. Core MVP - Modular Scraper Refactor - New

## User Story
As a System Administrator, I want to refactor the scraper to use a modular, source-specific router architecture, so that I can reliably execute the 10x10 success test and establish a maintainable foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given a clean database, when a scrape is triggered for 10 known sources, then 100 unique articles are successfully saved to the `scraped_content` table.
- [ ] The scraper uses `createCheerioRouter` with a unique, labeled handler for each of the 10 sources.
- [ ] Data is saved atomically using `context.pushData()` and a final batch insert.
- [ ] A `services/scraper/src/utils/` directory is created containing shared utilities:
  - [ ] `content-cleaner.ts` for common content cleaning operations
  - [ ] `date-parser.ts` for standardized date parsing
  - [ ] `url-normalizer.ts` for converting relative to absolute URLs
  - [ ] `logger.ts` for centralized structured logging
  - [ ] `errors.ts` defining the `HandlerError` class
- [ ] All 10 handlers conform to the Handler Quality Standards defined in requirements.md
- [ ] Each handler includes at least one unit test with HTML fixtures
