# Project: Veritas Scraper Refactor and Automation

**STATUS: FREEZED** (September 23, 2025)
**See `mid-project-notes.md` for detailed analysis and freeze rationale**

This project overhauls the Veritas scraper service to create a reliable, maintainable, and scalable content aggregation subsystem. The project has two primary objectives:

1. **Refactor**: Rearchitect the existing implementation into a modular, source-specific system using Crawlee's Router to improve reliability and maintainability.
2. **Semi-Automate**: Introduce a workflow to streamline the addition of new sources, using a generic fallback, a configuration generation script, and a clear process for creating new, specific handlers with LLM assistance.

## Freeze Summary
Core extraction functionality achieved through alternative implementation. ~30% of features implemented differently, 70% deemed unnecessary given current solution effectiveness. See mid-project notes for full analysis.
