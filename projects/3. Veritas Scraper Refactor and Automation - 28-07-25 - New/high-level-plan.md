# High-Level Plan: Veritas Scraper Refactor and Automation

### Phase 1: Core MVP Implementation (Story 1)
- **Objective**: Refactor the scraper to a modular router architecture.
- **Deliverable**: A working scraper with handlers for 10 known sources that passes the 10x10 success test.

### Phase 2: Semi-Automation Workflow (Stories 2, 3, 4)
- **Objective**: Build the tools and processes to streamline the addition of new sources.
- **Deliverables**:
    1. A generic fallback handler for unknown sources.
    2. A configuration generation script that outputs LLM-ready instructions.
    3. A successful end-to-end test of the entire new source onboarding process.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Stories 5 & 6 - Conditional)
- **Objective**: Implement advanced capabilities only if required.
- **Deliverables**: A potential upgrade to `PlaywrightCrawler` or the integration of proxies, based on the success of the previous phases.

### Final Phase: Documentation (Story 7)
- **Objective**: Update all project documentation.
- **Deliverable**: A fully documented system reflecting the new architecture and workflows.
