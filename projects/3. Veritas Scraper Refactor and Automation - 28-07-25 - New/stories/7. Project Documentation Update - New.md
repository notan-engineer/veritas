# 7. Project Documentation Update - New

## User Story
As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of the new scraper architecture and workflows, so that the codebase remains maintainable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `software-architecture.md` document is updated to describe the new router architecture, including the generic fallback handler.
- [ ] The new semi-automated workflow, including the use of the configuration generation script and LLM assistance, is documented as a new procedure.
- [ ] The documentation procedure in `keystone/procedures/documentation.md` is followed completely.
