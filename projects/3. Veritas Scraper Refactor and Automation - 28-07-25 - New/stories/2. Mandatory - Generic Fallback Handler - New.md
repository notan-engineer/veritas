# 2. Mandatory - Generic Fallback Handler - New

## User Story
As a Developer, I want the scraper to have a generic fallback handler, so that when a new source is added to the database without a specific code handler, the system still attempts a graceful, best-effort scrape instead of failing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A default handler is implemented in the `createCheerioRouter`.
- [ ] Given a source is added to the DB with no corresponding labeled handler in the code, when a scrape is run for that source, the default handler is executed.
- [ ] The default handler attempts to extract content using a predefined set of common, generic selectors (e.g., `<article>`, `<main>`, `h1`).
- [ ] The default handler logs a clear warning message indicating that a "generic scrape" was performed and that a specific handler should be created.
