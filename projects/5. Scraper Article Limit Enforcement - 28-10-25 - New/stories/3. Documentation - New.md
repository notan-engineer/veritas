# 3. Documentation - New

## User Story
As a **future developer**, I want **comprehensive documentation of the article limit implementation** so that **I can understand, maintain, and extend the system confidently**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given technical documentation exists, when I read it, then I understand how post-processing truncation works
- [ ] Given an Architecture Decision Record exists, when I review it, then I understand why this approach was chosen over alternatives
- [ ] Given a user guide exists, when I need to interpret metrics, then I can understand efficiency percentages and when to optimize
- [ ] Given code documentation exists, when I modify the scraper, then I can see inline comments explaining the truncation logic

## Technical Approach

### Database Changes
**None** - Documentation only.

### API Changes
**None** - Documentation only.

### Documentation Files to Create

#### 1. Feature Documentation
**File:** `documentation/features/article-limit-enforcement.md`

**Content Structure:**
- Overview and problem statement
- Implementation approach
- Code walkthrough with examples
- Testing and validation guide
- Metrics interpretation
- Future enhancement options

#### 2. Architecture Decision Record
**File:** `documentation/decisions/004-post-processing-article-limit.md`

**Content Structure:**
- Context and problem statement
- Decision: Post-processing truncation approach
- Alternatives considered:
  - Early termination in request handler
  - Dynamic queue sizing
  - Smarter queue management
- Rationale for chosen approach
- Consequences and trade-offs
- Future considerations

#### 3. Inline Code Documentation
**Files:**
- `services/scraper/src/enhanced-scraper.ts`
- `services/scraper/src/enhanced-logger.ts`

**Add comments:**
- Explain truncation logic
- Document efficiency calculation
- Note edge cases handled

### Implementation Context
```
Required files:
- @documentation/features/article-limit-enforcement.md (NEW)
- @documentation/decisions/004-post-processing-article-limit.md (NEW)
- @services/scraper/src/enhanced-scraper.ts (add comments)
- @services/scraper/src/enhanced-logger.ts (add comments)
```

## Success Test

### Validation Steps

1. **Review technical documentation:**
   - Read `documentation/features/article-limit-enforcement.md`
   - Verify completeness and accuracy
   - Check code examples work
   - Ensure testing guide is clear

2. **Review Architecture Decision Record:**
   - Read `documentation/decisions/004-post-processing-article-limit.md`
   - Verify decision rationale is clear
   - Check alternatives are fairly presented
   - Ensure consequences are documented

3. **Review inline documentation:**
   - Open enhanced-scraper.ts
   - Check comments explain truncation logic
   - Verify edge cases are documented
   - Ensure future maintainers can understand code

4. **Peer review:**
   - Have another developer read documentation
   - Ask: "Can you understand how this works?"
   - Ask: "Can you extend this in the future?"
   - Incorporate feedback

### Testing Utilities
- [ ] Manual review of documentation files
- [ ] Peer review process

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Technical documentation is complete
- [ ] ADR explains decision rationale
- [ ] Code has inline comments
- [ ] Examples are accurate and tested
- [ ] Future enhancement path is clear
- [ ] Peer review completed and feedback addressed

## Dependencies
- Previous stories: **Stories 1 and 2 must be complete** (documentation reflects actual implementation)
- External dependencies: None

## Implementation Notes

### Documentation Standards

**Follow Keystone Documentation Principles:**
- Write for future developers, not just current team
- Include "why" not just "what"
- Provide concrete examples
- Document edge cases and limitations
- Maintain consistency with existing docs

**Markdown Style Guide:**
- Use clear headings hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Use bullet points for readability
- Add links to related documentation
- Include date and author information

### Inline Documentation Guidelines

**Good Comment:**
```typescript
// Limit articles to target per source (first N extracted)
// This prevents over-saving while preserving temporal order
const articlesToSave = sourceResult.extractedArticles.slice(0, articlesPerSource);
```

**Bad Comment:**
```typescript
// Slice the array
const articlesToSave = sourceResult.extractedArticles.slice(0, articlesPerSource);
```

**Comment What Should Be Documented:**
- ✅ Why decisions were made
- ✅ Edge cases handled
- ✅ Performance considerations
- ✅ Future extension points
- ❌ What the code obviously does
- ❌ Obvious variable names
- ❌ Standard language features

### Documentation Maintenance

**Keep Documentation Current:**
- Update docs when code changes
- Review docs during PR process
- Mark outdated docs with deprecation notices
- Include doc updates in Definition of Done

**Documentation as Code:**
- Store in version control
- Review docs like code
- Test examples actually work
- Link docs to related code
