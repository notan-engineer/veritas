# Story 6: Testing and Validation

**Status**: Done
**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Stories 1-5 (all logging enhancements)

## User Story

As a **developer ensuring logging system reliability**,
I want **comprehensive tests validating all logging enhancements**,
So that **I can be confident logs accurately reflect reality**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Unit tests cover all new logging methods
2. ✅ Integration tests validate end-to-end scenarios
3. ✅ Performance tests confirm overhead <5%
4. ✅ Test scenarios cover success, failure, and edge cases
5. ✅ Manual testing validates UI compatibility

## Test Scenarios

### TS1: Normal Job - All Sources Successful
- Request 10 articles from BBC, CNN, Reuters
- All RSS feeds available, no extraction failures
- **Expected**: Logs match database, zero discrepancies

### TS2: Job with Extraction Failures
- Request 10 articles from BBC
- Simulate 50% extraction failure rate
- **Expected**: Lifecycle logs show failures, reconciliation passes

### TS3: Job with Duplicate Detection
- Request 10 articles from CNN
- 5 already exist in database
- **Expected**: Skipped lifecycle events, persistence logs show duplicates

### TS4: Job with Source Attribution Bug
- Mock bug causing wrong source_id assignment
- **Expected**: Attribution logs show mismatched domains, reconciliation flags critical discrepancy

### TS5: Job with RSS Failure
- Reuters RSS returns 404
- **Expected**: Zero extraction/persistence for Reuters, reconciliation passes

## Implementation

### Unit Tests (`enhanced-scraper.test.ts`)
```typescript
describe('Database Verification', () => {
  it('should detect discrepancies between logs and database');
  it('should handle sources with zero articles');
  it('should include sample article IDs');
});

describe('Article Lifecycle Tracking', () => {
  it('should generate unique tracking IDs');
  it('should log all lifecycle stages');
  it('should preserve tracking ID through pipeline');
});

describe('Reconciliation', () => {
  it('should flag discrepancies correctly');
  it('should calculate severity levels');
  it('should handle missing sources');
});
```

### Integration Tests (`enhanced-scraper.integration.test.ts`)
```typescript
describe('End-to-End Logging', () => {
  it('should log complete article journey from queue to DB');
  it('should verify final counts match database');
  it('should reconcile all metrics correctly');
});
```

### Performance Tests
```typescript
describe('Logging Performance', () => {
  it('should complete verification query in <200ms');
  it('should add <10ms overhead per article');
  it('should have <5% total job overhead');
});
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run scraping job with all enhancements enabled
- [ ] Check logs in database for all event types
- [ ] View logs in UI dashboard
- [ ] Verify JSON rendering in UI
- [ ] Test log filtering by event_type
- [ ] Confirm no UI errors or display issues
- [ ] Measure job duration impact

## Performance Benchmarks

**Baseline** (current system):
- 10 articles per source, 3 sources
- Total job time: ~6-8 seconds

**Target** (with enhancements):
- Same job configuration
- Total job time: <8.5 seconds (max 5% overhead)
- Verification query: <200ms
- Per-article logging: <10ms

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests covering main scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests validate overhead limits
- [ ] Manual testing completed successfully
- [ ] UI compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for new code
- [ ] Documentation includes testing guide
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged

## Notes

- Critical story - validates all previous work
- Performance testing ensures production viability
- Manual UI testing prevents breaking changes
- Foundation for continuous monitoring
