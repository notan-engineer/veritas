## Code Documentation Standards

```typescript
/**
 * Verifies persistence results by querying database for actual saved counts.
 *
 * This method provides ground truth by directly querying scraped_content table
 * and comparing with what the persistence layer claimed to save.
 *
 * @param jobId - UUID of the scraping job
 * @param persistenceResults - Map of source name to claimed persistence results
 * @returns Map of source name to actual database counts with sample IDs
 * @throws Error if database query fails
 *
 * @example
 * const dbCounts = await verifyPersistenceResults(jobId, persistenceResults);
 * for (const [source, count] of dbCounts) {
 *   console.log(`${source}: ${count} articles in database`);
 * }
 */
private async verifyPersistenceResults(
  jobId: string,
  persistenceResults: Map<string, SourcePersistenceResult>
): Promise<Map<string, DatabaseVerificationResult>>
```
