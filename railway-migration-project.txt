# Railway Migration Project Plan - Veritas System
## Full Migration from Vercel to Railway

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the complete migration of the Veritas system from Vercel to Railway platform, following suggestion #2 from the architectural analysis. The migration is structured in two main phases:

**Phase 1**: UI Migration (Keep Supabase)
**Phase 2**: Database Migration to Railway PostgreSQL

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Estimated Cost**: $5-20/month (significant savings from potential future scaling costs)
**Risk Level**: Medium (with extensive testing and rollback procedures)

**Key Benefits**:
- Unified platform for all services
- Cost optimization for future scaling
- Native support for scraping services and LLM integration
- Simplified deployment and management
- Enhanced developer experience

### CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Every step must be independently testable
2. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert at any stage
3. **Future-Ready Architecture**: Prepared for scraping and LLM services
4. **Cost Optimization**: Maintain lowest possible costs

### ARCHITECTURAL REDESIGN

The codebase will be restructured to support the three central components:

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Branch Management Protocol**

**Cursor should ONLY work with the railway-migration branch**

#### For Cursor/AI Development:
1. **Always work on railway-migration branch**
2. **Never directly modify main branch**  
3. **All development happens in railway-migration**
4. **Regular commits to railway-migration branch**

#### For Manual Pull Requests:
1. **Pull requests are created manually by project owner only**
2. **PRs from railway-migration → main**
3. **Manual review and approval process**
4. **No automated merging**

#### Current Branch Status:
- **Active Development Branch:** railway-migration ✅
- **Production Branch:** main
- **Deployment Source:** main branch (via Railway GitHub integration)

### 2. Database Migration Data Loss
**Risk**: Data corruption or loss during PostgreSQL migration
**Mitigation**: 
- Multiple backup strategies
- Incremental migration with validation
- Keep Supabase as backup during transition period

### 3. Environment Variable Configuration
**Risk**: Missing or incorrect environment variables causing service failures
**Mitigation**: 
- Comprehensive environment variable audit
- Testing in staging environment first
- Documentation of all required variables

### 4. Cost Overruns
**Risk**: Railway costs exceeding budget expectations
**Mitigation**: 
- Set up usage alerts and limits
- Monitor resource consumption closely
- Start with minimal resource allocation

### 5. Service Interdependencies
**Risk**: Future services may have complex interdependencies
**Mitigation**: 
- Design clear service boundaries from the start
- Implement proper service communication patterns
- Document all service interfaces

### 6. Deployment Pipeline Failures
**Risk**: Failed deployments causing downtime
**Mitigation**: 
- Test deployment pipeline thoroughly
- Implement automated rollback procedures
- Use blue-green deployment strategy
