## 🛠️ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

### **Important: Branch Management Protocol**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Cursor should ONLY work with the railway-migration branch**

#### For Cursor/AI Development:
1. **Always work on railway-migration branch**
2. **Never directly modify main branch**
3. **All development happens in railway-migration**
4. **Regular commits to railway-migration branch**

#### For Manual Pull Requests:
1. **Pull requests are created manually by project owner only**
2. **PRs from railway-migration → main**
3. **Manual review and approval process**
4. **No automated merging**

#### Current Branch Status:
- **Active Development Branch:** railway-migration ✅
- **Production Branch:** main
- **Deployment Source:** main branch (via Railway GitHub integration)
