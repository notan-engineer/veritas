# Veritas System Enhancement - Suggested Design & Architecture

## Executive Summary

Based on the current Veritas architecture and your requirements for adding scraping services and open-source LLM integration, this report presents three potential approaches. Each approach addresses the core limitations of Vercel's serverless platform while attempting to maintain cost-effectiveness, development simplicity, and user experience.

**Key Requirements Analysis:**
- High-frequency scraping (every few minutes) - ❌ Not supported by Vercel
- Open-source LLM integration - ❌ Not supported by Vercel  
- Background processing - ❌ Not supported by Vercel
- Cost optimization - ✅ Achievable with proper architecture
- Development simplicity - ✅ Possible with right platform choices
- GitHub integration - ✅ Available on most modern platforms

## Approach 1: Hybrid Architecture (Recommended)

### **Overview**
Maintain Vercel for the frontend while adding Railway for backend services. This approach preserves your current development experience while adding the necessary capabilities for scraping and LLM processing.

### **Architecture Components**

#### **Frontend (Vercel - Keep Current)**
- Next.js application remains on Vercel
- Static optimization and CDN benefits retained
- Current deployment pipeline unchanged
- Supabase integration maintained

#### **Backend Services (Railway)**
- **Scraping Service**: Python/Node.js service with cron scheduling
- **LLM Processing Service**: Docker container running open-source LLM
- **API Gateway**: Express.js/FastAPI for service coordination
- **Job Queue**: Redis-based queue for processing tasks

#### **Data Flow**
```
Sources → Scraping Service → Raw Content → LLM Service → Factoids → Supabase → Vercel Frontend
```

### **Technology Stack**
- **Platform**: Railway (for backend services)
- **Scraping**: Python with Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, or Playwright
- **LLM**: Llama 2/3, Mistral, or Code Llama in Docker container
- **Queue**: Redis or Railway's built-in PostgreSQL for job queues
- **Orchestration**: Railway's cron jobs + internal service communication
- **Monitoring**: Railway's built-in logging + custom health checks

### **Implementation Strategy**

#### **Phase 1: Scraping Service Setup**
1. Create Railway project with Python service
2. Implement RSS feed parsers and web scrapers
3. Set up cron jobs for periodic execution (every 2-5 minutes)
4. Store raw content in Supabase `scraped_content` table
5. Implement error handling and retry logic

#### **Phase 2: LLM Integration**
1. Deploy open-source LLM in Docker container on Railway
2. Create factoid extraction API endpoint
3. Implement content processing pipeline
4. Add quality scoring and confidence metrics
5. Update Supabase with processed factoids

#### **Phase 3: Integration & Optimization**
1. Connect services through internal Railway networking
2. Implement job queue for processing management
3. Add monitoring and alerting
4. Optimize for cost and performance

### **Cost Estimation**
- **Railway**: $5-20/month (depending on usage)
- **Vercel**: Free tier (current usage)
- **Supabase**: Free tier (current usage)
- **Total**: $5-20/month

### **Pros**
✅ **Minimal disruption**: Keep current frontend deployment  
✅ **Cost-effective**: Railway offers generous free tier + affordable scaling  
✅ **GitHub integration**: Railway has excellent GitHub integration  
✅ **Docker support**: Full container support for LLM deployment  
✅ **Cron jobs**: Native support for scheduled tasks  
✅ **Familiar experience**: Similar deployment experience to Vercel  
✅ **Incremental migration**: Can migrate piece by piece  

### **Cons**
❌ **Multi-platform complexity**: Managing two deployment platforms  
❌ **Potential latency**: Additional network hop between services  
❌ **Data consistency**: Need to ensure synchronization between platforms  
❌ **Monitoring complexity**: Need to monitor multiple platforms
