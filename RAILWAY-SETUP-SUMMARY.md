# Railway Setup Summary

## Production Database Seeding Implementation ✅

### Overview
Implemented automatic database seeding that runs after each Railway deployment build completes.

### How It Works
1. **Build Process**: Railway runs `npm run build` during deployment
2. **Post-Build Hook**: After build completes, `postbuild` script automatically executes
3. **Safety Check**: Seeding only runs in production environment (`NODE_ENV=production`)
4. **Database Population**: Comprehensive seeding with sources, tags, factoids, and relationships

### Key Files
- `database/seed-railway-deploy.js` - Production-optimized seeding script
- `services/ui/package.json` - Contains `postbuild` script configuration
- `infrastructure/railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration

### Environment Safety
- ✅ **Production**: Automatic seeding after deployment
- ✅ **Development**: Seeding skipped by default (safety check)
- ✅ **Testing**: Use `FORCE_SEED=true` to override locally

### Available Scripts
```bash
# Automatic (runs on Railway)
npm run build                     # Triggers postbuild seeding in production

# Manual testing
npm run test:seed:deploy          # Test seeding locally with FORCE_SEED=true
npm run railway:seed              # Alternative seeding via Railway CLI
npm run railway:status            # Check Railway connection status
```

### Production Deployment Flow
1. Code pushed to Railway
2. Railway runs build process
3. `npm run build` compiles Next.js application
4. `postbuild` script runs `seed-railway-deploy.js`
5. Database seeded with mock data (sources, tags, factoids)
6. Application starts with populated database

### Benefits
- 🔄 **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
- 🛡️ **Safe**: Environment checks prevent accidental local seeding  
- 🚀 **Fast**: Optimized for Railway's internal networking
- 📊 **Complete**: Full data model with relationships
- 🔍 **Verifiable**: Built-in data verification and logging

### Next Steps
- Database is ready for production use
- Frontend can consume factoids via API endpoints
- Data model supports multilingual content (EN/HE/AR)
- Search functionality enabled with full-text indexes

## Previous Setup Steps (Completed)

### 1. Railway Project Creation ✅
- Project: `Veritas` (ID: 32900e57-b721-494d-8e68-d15ac01e5c03)
- Team: notan-engineer
- Public URL: https://veritas-production-e04f.up.railway.app

### 2. PostgreSQL Service ✅  
- Provider: Railway PostgreSQL
- Database: `railway`
- SSL: Enabled for production
- Internal networking: `veritas-92f16e9c.railway.internal`

### 3. Environment Configuration ✅
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- Database credentials: Auto-injected by Railway
- Supabase keys: Configured for public access

### 4. API Implementation ✅
- REST endpoints for factoids, tags, sources
- Full-text search capabilities
- Input validation and error handling
- TypeScript interfaces and validators
