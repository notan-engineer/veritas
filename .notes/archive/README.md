# Archive - Legacy Cursor Framework Files

**Archived Date**: 15-07-25  
**Reason**: Framework consolidation into single master file

## Archived Files

This directory contains the original 9 procedure files that were consolidated into `.notes/cursor-master-guide.md`:

1. **optimization-checklist.md** - Comprehensive checklist (consolidated into master guide)
2. **error-resolution-guide.md** - Error procedures (now in [BASIC] Error Resolution)
3. **context-templates.md** - File templates (now in [BASIC] Context Selection)
4. **quick-reference.md** - Commands/patterns (now in Quick Command Reference)
5. **documentation-optimization-guide.md** - Doc strategy (now in Documentation Strategy)
6. **plan-first-prompting-guide.md** - Planning procedures (now in [ADVANCED] Plan-First)
7. **tab-management-guide.md** - Workspace organization (now in Tab Management)
8. **session-reset-protocol.md** - Session boundaries (now in Session Management)
9. **surgical-context-guide.md** - Core principle (now in Core Principles)

## Why Archived?

- **Duplication**: Major overlap between files (e.g., "@file not @folder" in 5 files)
- **Cognitive Load**: 11 files created decision fatigue
- **Simplification**: Single master file provides 100% coverage
- **Maintenance**: One source of truth easier to maintain

## Using the Archive

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding consolidation decisions
- Rollback capability if needed

**For active development, use `.notes/cursor-master-guide.md` exclusively.**
