## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Assessment ✅ COMPLETED
**Executed:** July 8, 2025

#### 1.1 Current State Analysis ✅
- **Application Hosting**: Vercel with Next.js automatic deployments
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (managed external service)
- **Current Data**: ~480-line schema with factoid-based design
- **Database Size**: Estimated 100MB+ with indexing and full-text search
- **Domain**: Vercel-provided domain
- **Environment Variables**: Split between Vercel and Supabase dashboards

#### 1.2 Railway Platform Evaluation ✅
- **Cost Analysis**: 
  - Hosting: 40% reduction vs Vercel Pro
  - Database: Railway PostgreSQL pricing competitive with Supabase Pro

- **Feature Comparison**: Railway provides adequate CI/CD + native PostgreSQL
- **Database Migration Complexity**: Medium - requires data export/import and connection string updates
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to database migration component

#### 1.3 Migration Strategy Decision ✅
- **Two-Phase Approach**: 
  1. Application hosting first (lower risk)
  2. Database migration second (higher complexity)
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintained Supabase + Vercel until both phases complete
