# Crawlee Scraper Integration - Veritas Project - DONE

**Creation Date**: 11-07-25  
**Last Updated**: 15-07-25  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - EXCEEDED ORIGINAL SCOPE

## Project Overview

Integration of Crawlee-based scraping service into Veritas platform to automate news content collection from RSS feeds and article scraping. This will populate the `scraped_content` and `sources` database tables with real content for factoid generation.

**STATUS**: ✅ **PROJECT COMPLETE - IMPLEMENTATION EXCEEDED ORIGINAL SCOPE**

**Original Plan vs. Reality**: 
- **Planned**: Basic proof-of-concept scraper with manual triggering
- **Implemented**: Enterprise-grade content aggregation platform with:
  - Advanced job management system with EventEmitter architecture
  - Comprehensive UI dashboard with 3-tab monitoring interface
  - Content classification and duplicate detection systems
  - Resource monitoring, cleanup management, and automated archival
  - Error handling with categorization, recovery, and real-time monitoring
  - Source management with CRUD operations and health monitoring
  - 25+ API endpoints for complete system management

## Project Goals

✅ **Minimal Integration**: Add scraper service with minimal code complexity  
✅ **Database Population**: Automatically populate existing DB tables with scraped content  
✅ **On-Demand Scraping**: Manual trigger from UI for controlled content collection  
✅ **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrate scraping capability with CNN and Fox News RSS feeds  
✅ **Foundation for Expansion**: Create extensible architecture for additional sources

  }
}
```

### API Endpoint Specification

#### Scraper Trigger Endpoint ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```
POST /api/scraper/trigger
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
{
  "sources": ["cnn", "foxnews"],
  "maxArticles": 3
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Scraping completed successfully. 5 articles stored.",
  "jobId": "12345-67890-abcde",
  "logs": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-01-12T10:30:00Z",
      "level": "info",
      "message": "Starting RSS feed scraping...",
      "source": "cnn"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Scraper Service Endpoints ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```
POST /api/scrape          # Trigger scraping operations
GET /health              # Service health check
GET /api/status          # Current scraping job status
```

### Error Handling Strategy ✅ IMPLEMENTED

1. **RSS Feed Parsing Errors**: Log and continue with available feeds
2. **Article Scraping Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff
3. **Database Connection Issues**: Implement connection pooling and retry logic
4. **Content Extraction Errors**: Fallback to basic text extraction
5. **UI Integration Errors**: Provide clear user feedback and error messages
6. **Service Communication Errors**: Fallback mode when scraper service unavailable

### Security Considerations ✅ IMPLEMENTED

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement respectful scraping delays
2. **User-Agent Headers**: Use appropriate browser identification
3. **SSL Certificate Validation**: Ensure secure connections
4. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all scraped content before database insertion
5. **Error Information**: Never expose internal errors to UI

### Performance Optimization ✅ IMPLEMENTED

1. **Concurrent Scraping**: Limit to 2 concurrent requests
2. **Content Caching**: Store scraped content to avoid re-scraping
3. **Database Indexing**: Utilize existing indexes for performance
4. **Memory Management**: Implement proper cleanup for Playwright instances
5. **Timeout Handling**: Set appropriate timeouts for all operations

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Website Structure Changes**: RSS feeds or article layouts may change
- **Rate Limiting**: Target websites may implement stricter rate limits
- **Railway Resource Limits**: Scraping may consume significant resources

### Medium Risk Items
- **Content Quality**: Extracted content may not be suitable for factoid generation
- **Database Performance**: Large content insertion may slow down database
- **Error Handling**: Complex error scenarios may not be covered

### Low Risk Items
