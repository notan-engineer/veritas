# Railway Migration Project Plan

**Plan Created:** July 8, 2025  
**Last Updated:** July 12, 2025  
**Status:** üîÑ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Project:** Migration from Vercel to Railway Platform (Infrastructure + Database)

---

## Executive Summary

**Objective:** Migrate Veritas from Vercel + Supabase to Railway platform for unified infrastructure, improved cost optimization, and simplified deployment management.

**Rationale:**
- **Cost Optimization**: Railway offers better pricing for our usage patterns
- **Unified Infrastructure**: Single platform for hosting and database management
- **Simplified Management**: Reduced vendor complexity from 2 platforms to 1
- **Better PostgreSQL Integration**: Native Railway PostgreSQL with better performance
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Unified observability across all services
- **Future-Ready**: Better support for microservices architecture when needed

**Current Status:** Application hosting migration completed ‚úÖ, Database migration pending ‚è∏Ô∏è
