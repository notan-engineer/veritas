# Veritas Project - AI Development Rules

**Last Updated**: 11-07-25 (Use dynamic dates from `lib/utils.ts`)  
**Project Status**: Maximally simplified (85% complexity reduction), production-ready  
**For**: AI coding agents and human developers

## Project Context

**Veritas** is a lean news aggregation platform presenting verified information as structured "factoids". The system was recently simplified through massive code reduction (2,235+ lines removed) while maintaining 100% functionality.

### Core Mission
Transform news consumption by presenting only verified facts in easily digestible format, eliminating information overload.

## Technology Stack (Current)

```
Framework: Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router (React 19.0.0)
Language: TypeScript 5 (strict mode enabled)
Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
UI: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
Database: Railway PostgreSQL with connection pooling
Deployment: Railway (minimal configuration)
```

## File Structure (Simplified)
```

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- Write minimum code necessary to achieve goal
- Favor existing solutions over creating new ones
- Question complexity - if something seems complex, find simpler approach
- Use established patterns rather than inventing new ones

### 2. Incremental Development
- Add features only when actually needed
- Start with minimal viable implementation
- Test thoroughly before expanding functionality
- Document changes immediately

### 3. Build Validation (CRITICAL)
- Test after every significant change
- **CRITICAL**: ALL build commands MUST be run from `services/ui` directory
- Required: `cd services/ui && npm run build && npm run lint` must pass (PowerShell: use `;` instead of `&&`)
- **NEVER run build from project root** - it will fail
- Manual testing of changed functionality
- No commits without successful builds

## Current System State

### Database (6 tables only)
```sql
factoids         -- Core content (title, description, bullet_points, language, status)
sources          -- News sources (name, domain, url, description)  
scraped_content  -- Raw content (for future scraper service)
tags             -- Simple categorization (name, slug, description)
factoid_tags     -- Many-to-many factoid-tag relationships
factoid_sources  -- Many-to-many factoid-source relationships
```

### API Endpoints (2 only)
- `GET /api/factoids` - All published factoids with relationships
- `GET /api/tags` - All active tags for filtering

### Pages (3 only)
- Homepage (`/`) - Factoid cards with topic filtering
- Article Detail (`/article/[id]`) - Individual factoid display
- Settings (`/settings`) - Theme toggle only

### Components (Essential only)
- Card, Button, Badge - Core UI elements
- Skeleton - Loading states
- Switch, ThemeToggle - Settings
- NO authentication, user management, or complex forms

## Mandatory Documentation Rules

### CRITICAL: Update these files with every relevant commit
1. **`documentation/technical-design.md`** - Architecture/database changes
2. **`documentation/developer-guidelines.md`** - Development practice changes  
3. **`documentation/product-requirements.md`** - Feature/UX changes

### Documentation Standards
- Keep concise and LLM-optimized
- Remove outdated content immediately
- Include current status and next steps
- Use dynamic dates from `lib/utils.ts`

## Branching & Workflow (Absolute Rules)

- **NEVER push directly to main branch**
- Always create feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/description`
- Test thoroughly before requesting review
- Update documentation in same branch as code changes
- Manual merge only by project maintainer

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Requirements
- Strict mode enabled - no `any` types without justification
- Comprehensive interfaces for data structures
- Type safety at boundaries - validate external data

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// ✅ Use shadcn/ui components
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

// ✅ Standard component pattern
interface ComponentProps {
  data: DataType
  onAction?: (id: string) => void
}

export function Component({ data, onAction }: ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{data.title}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        {/* Component content */}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

### Database Development

#### Current Schema (Simplified)
- **NO user management** (removed for simplicity)
- **NO authentication system** (removed for simplicity)  
- **NO complex scoring** (removed for simplicity)
- **Read-optimized** (no update tracking, simple timestamps)

#### Data Access Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ Server-side (pages/API routes)
import { getFactoidById } from '@/lib/data.server'
const factoid = await getFactoidById(id)

// ✅ Client-side (components)
import { getAllFactoids } from '@/lib/data-service'
const factoids = await getAllFactoids()
```

### RTL Support (Required)
```typescript
import { getRTLClasses, getRTLContainerClasses } from "@/lib/rtl-utils"

<div className={getRTLContainerClasses(language)}>
  <h1 className={getRTLClasses(language)}>{title}</h1>
</div>
```

### Date Handling (Required)
```typescript
import { getFormattedDate } from "@/lib/utils"

// ✅ Use dynamic dates (never hardcode dates)
const date = getFormattedDate('display') // "July 11, 2025"
const shortDate = getFormattedDate('short') // "2025-07-11"
```

## AI Agent Specific Guidelines

### Decision-Making Priorities
When choosing between options, prefer:
1. **Simpler solution** over complex solution
2. **Existing library** over custom implementation
3. **Configuration change** over code change
4. **Proven pattern** over experimental approach

### Incremental Development (CRITICAL)
- Work in small, testable iterations (15-30 minutes max)
- Test current state before making changes
- Validate each step before proceeding
- Run `cd services/ui && npm run build && npm run lint` after each logical change
- **REMEMBER**: Always change to `services/ui` directory before build/lint commands
- Keep backup of original code when making significant changes

### Code Changes
- Always read current documentation before making changes
- Use existing patterns rather than creating new ones
- Test changes thoroughly before considering complete
- Update documentation in same commit as code changes

### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
try {
  const data = await databaseFunction()
  if (!data) {
    throw new Error(`Data not found: ${id}`)
  }
  return data
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error)
  throw new Error(`Database error: ${error.message}`)
}
```

## Removed Features Reference

### Available for Re-implementation
See `documentation/removed-code-and-features.md` for:
- **Authentication system** (JWT-based when needed)
- **Search functionality** (start simple, upgrade gradually)
- **User interactions** (like/dislike/comment system)
- **Advanced validation** (per-form as needed)
- **Development tools** (specific scripts when team grows)

### Implementation Approach
1. Check removed features documentation for lessons learned
2. Start with minimal version
3. Test thoroughly at each step
4. Document new additions immediately

## Railway Infrastructure

### Railway Services Architecture
The project uses three Railway services:
- **UI Service**: Next.js application
- **Scraper Service**: Crawlee-based content scraping
- **Database Service**: PostgreSQL instance

**Reference**: See `documentation/railway-interface.md` for complete Railway CLI commands, service management, and deployment procedures. This file is git-ignored and contains sensitive project information.

## Environment & Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... # Automatically provided by Railway
NODE_ENV=production          # Automatically set by Railway
PORT=${{PORT}}              # Automatically set by Railway
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: ALWAYS cd to services/ui first - builds WILL FAIL from project root
cd services/ui   
npm run dev      # Development server
npm run build    # Production build (MUST pass)
npm run start    # Production server
npm run lint     # ESLint check (MUST pass)
```

**PowerShell Note**: Use separate commands: `cd services/ui; npm run build; npm run lint`
**⚠️ NEVER run npm commands from project root - always from services/ui**

## Deployment (Ultra-simplified)

### Railway Configuration (7 lines only)
```toml
[[services]]
name = "ui"
source = "services/ui"

[services.ui.build]
buildCommand = "npm install && npm run build"

[services.ui.deploy]  
startCommand = "npm start"
```

### Process
1. Work on feature branch
2. Test: `cd services/ui && npm run build && npm run lint`
3. Manual merge to main
4. Railway auto-deploys
5. Verify production functionality

## Project Status Summary

**Current**: Core functionality operational, ready for incremental expansion  
**Complexity**: Reduced by 85% (2,235+ lines removed, 3 directories eliminated)  
**Next**: Feature additions based on user needs  
**Key Insight**: Start minimal, add incrementally, test thoroughly, document everything

## Emergency Procedures

### Build Failures
1. Check TypeScript errors first
2. Verify all imports are correct
3. Ensure removed files aren't referenced
4. Test with fresh `npm install`

### Production Issues
1. Check Railway dashboard for errors
2. Use Railway deployment history for rollback
3. Document issue and resolution
4. Update guidelines to prevent recurrence

Remember: Good software solves problems with the least appropriate code while maintaining quality and functionality.
